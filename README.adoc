= skip

Skippy McSkipface - A general Clojure dependency tracker.

Lisp systems are especially suited to develop systems which must or can run indefinitely, where all changes are 'continuously delivered' as a series of patches. If you feel annoyed by your Clojure systems slow start up time, you might just being 'doing it all wrong'.

Skip allows us to avoid waste by eliminating unnecessary work that a system might otherwise perform in order to bring itself up-to-date.

You can use skip to create dependency graphs, mixing together files, templates, build artefacts, config, namespaces, components and other resources.

Dependency resolvers are supplied for common cases.

== Axioms

A *dependency* has a *status*: *fresh*, if it is up-to-date, or *stale* otherwise.

A *dependant* depends on the status of its dependencies.

A dependant can be a dependency of other dependants.

Each dependant can report its status.

A dependant is stale if any of its dependencies are stale.

Dependants can be *freshened*, which usually involves doing *work*.

A dependant that is already fresh doesn't need to be freshened. Work is avoided (skipped).

The act of freshening a dependant might cause that dependant to change, so it is returned as a value.

Each dependant can *explain* what it would do were it to be asked to freshen itself.

== Installation

Add the following dependency to your +project.clj+ or +build.boot+ file
